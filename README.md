# teatanic
Teatanic is an iOS application that simulates a tea shop. A user is able to search among different tea types and "buy" it.

# purpose
This application intends to provide an example on how to:
- use **Core Data**
- use **Firebase** (make sure you create your own Firebase Realtime Database; you can use the *teas.json* in order to populate your db)
- implement *custom menu* (credits to https://johncodeos.com/)
- implement *custom popups/toasts*
- implement *communication between view controllers*
- improve UI using *background threads* from DispatchQueue
